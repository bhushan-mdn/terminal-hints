If you want to learn about using the command line use one of the following:

## zsh
Install zsh and oh-my-zsh for managing plugins.
The following plugins have been really useful:
1. [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
2. [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
3. fzf (for reverse history search and directory search).
   Usually I source them directly after installing fzf.
   ```
   source $HOME/.local/share/fzf/key-bindings.zsh
   source $HOME/.local/share/fzf/completion.zsh
   ```
